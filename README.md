MAMP is a PHP and MySQL server that can replicate the server environment in which the AIO project will be hosted.

It is recommended that you clone the repository into the ../MAMP/htdocs folder. This will automatically locally host whatever is present in your local git repository and files donâ€™t need to be copied back to the git repo folder in order to commit and push development changes.

Preferences can be set for MAMP to change the directory location of the apache server if desired.
